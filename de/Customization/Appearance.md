### Base mode

Obsidian comes with two "Base Modes", light and dark. Dark is the default. We call it a "mode" rather than a "theme" because the base mode is the foundation that a custom theme works on top of.

You can change your base mode in Settings -> Appearance.

### Custom theme

As a great starting point, once you enable custom CSS, there are lots of community themes contributed by our amazing community that you can easily choose from.

Once you choose a community theme, you can still add your own tweaks to it by modifying the `obsidian.css` file.

### Translucency

You can make the window translucent by enabling this option in the settings appearance tab. Currently this option is only available for Windows and macOS.

There is a known issue under Windows where dragging the window is extremely slow when translucency is enabled. This is due to a Windows bug. A Github issue tracking the status of a fix can be found here: https://github.com/riverar/sample-win32-acrylicblur/issues/2
